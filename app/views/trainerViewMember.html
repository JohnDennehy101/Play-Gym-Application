<!--

The 'trainerViewMember' view allows trainers to see all assessments for a given member.

It is from this view that trainers can add comments for individual assessments.

The trainer can return to the member list view by clicking the 'Return To List Of Members' button at the
bottom of the page.

<!-- Header component which displays the member name, BMI, BMI category and if they are at the ideal weight or not  -->

#{dashboardMemberHeaderDetails member:member, bmi:bmi, bmiCategory:bmiCategory, isIdealWeight:isIdealWeight/}

<!--
The listAssessmentsTrainerView component lists all assessments for the member. Trainers can add
comments for any assessment.
-->

#{listAssessmentsTrainerView assessments:assessments, member:member /}

<!--
If assessments have been completed for the member, the returnToTrainerDashBoard component is displayed which
includes a button which, when clicked, redirects the trainer back to the list of members.

If statement is included here to avoid duplication of button as button is already displayed on the component
if no assessments have been completed.
